# Data Archive

This repository serves as research archive for the Master's thesis 'The Influence of Teacher-based Routing on the Accuracy and Classification of Multistage Tests" for the masters programme Methodology & Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Science of Utrecht University.

*Contents*


* Data; Folder where data are stored.
* Figures; Folder containing the figures used in the manuscript. 
* Overig; Folder with source files for images and tables that are used in the analyses/simulations. 
* Research Report; Folder containing the research report and analysis pertaining to appendix A.
* Results; Folder where results are stored.
* SourceFiles; Folder containing files that are sourced.
* Thesis; Folder containing the thesis and ethical clearance form. 
* 1. Data Simulation.R; Contains script used for data simulation
* 2. Simulation Designs.R; Contains script used for simulation of different teacher-based routing MST designs
* 3. Assumptions.R; Contains script checking assumptions
* 4a. SEM.R; Contains script analyzing standard error of measurement
* 4b. Track placement recommendations.R; Contains script analyzing the track placement recommendations

To replicate the findings in the paper, run "1. Data Simulation.R", "2. Simulation Designs.R", "3. Assumptions.R", "4a. SEM.R", "4b. Track placement recommendations.R" in this specific order. 
The final data simulation was run on may 7th-9th, 2020 by Marie Buijs (see "1. Data Simulation.R" for more details on the version number of the software and operation system of the machine). 

*Permission and access*

The simulations are based on non-public microdata from Statistic Netherlands (CBS). The raw data were analyzed using R in the remote secured online environemnt of CBS. Before exporting the results, the results were tested by CBS to prevent publication of identifiable information about individuals. 
The results pertaining the number of (mis)matches between teacher's and EPST recommendation are used in the current simulation study and can be found in the folder Overig; file tabel5.xlsx.  
The R code used to obtain this table as well as the other tables/figures used in the research report, can be found in the Researc Report file. 
  
The research archive is available through github.com/MJBuijs. The Github repository is public, and therefore 'open access'. The data will be stored for a minimal duration of ten years.
