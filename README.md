# Data Archive

This repository serves as research archive for the Master's thesis 'The Influence of Teacher-based Routing on the Accuracy and Classification of Multistage Tests" for the masters programme Methodology & Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Science at Utrecht University. The final data simulation was run on may 7th-9th, 2020 by Marie Buijs. 

## Data storage

### *Contents*

| Files/Folders  |  Description   |
|---|---|
| Data  | Folder with simulated data (not included due to size)  |  
| Figures  | Folder with the figures used in the manuscript  |   
| Research Report  |  Folder containing the research report and analysis pertaining to appendix A  | 
| Results  |  Folder where results are stored (not included due to size) | 
| SourceFiles  | Folder containing files that are sourced (including a seperate ReadMe file) | 
| Table for simulation  | Folder containing the table used as basis for the data simulation | 
| Documents  |  Folder containing the thesis and ethical clearance form.  | 
| 1.Data Simulation.R  | Contains script used for data simulation.  | 
| 2. Simulation Designs.R  |  Contains script used for simulation of different teacher-based routing MST designs. | 
| 3. Assumptions.R  |  Contains script checking assumptions. | 
| 4a. SEM.R | Contains script analyzing standard error of measurement.  | 
| 4b. Track placement recommendations.R |  Contains script analyzing the track placement recommendations. | 

### *Replicating the analysis*

To replicate the findings in the paper, run "1. Data Simulation.R", "2. Simulation Designs.R", "3. Assumptions.R", "4a. SEM.R", "4b. Track placement recommendations.R" in this order. (see "1. Data Simulation.R" for more details on the version number of the software and operation system of the machine). 

## Privacy 

The simulations are based on non-public microdata from Statistic Netherlands (CBS). The microdata were analyzed in the remote secured online environment of CBS. Before any results were exported from the remote secured online environment of Statistics Netherlands, the CBS tested the results to prevent publication of any identifiable information about individuals. 
For this thesis, only the contingency table from the teacher's recommendation and the EPST recommendation was used. No information about individuals can be obtained from this table. 
For the research report an additional table containing the placement in the third year of secondary education for students with 3 or more levels mismatch between the teacher's recommendation and the EPST recommendation was used. No specific teacher's recommendation and/or EPST recommendations are mentioned in this table, thus no information about individuals can be obtained from (the combination of ) this table(s).
