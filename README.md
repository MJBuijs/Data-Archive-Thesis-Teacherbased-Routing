# Data Archive

This repository serves as research archive for the Master's thesis 'The Influence of Teacher-based Routing on the Accuracy and Classification of Multistage Tests" for the masters programme Methodology & Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Science at Utrecht University. The final data simulation was run on may 7th-9th, 2020 by Marie Buijs.

### *Replicating the analysis*
To replicate the findings in the paper, run "1. Data Simulation.R", "2. Simulation Designs.R", "3. Assumptions.R", "4a. SEM.R", "4b. Track placement recommendations.R" in this order. (see "1. Data Simulation.R" for more details on the version number of the software and operation system of the machine). 

## Privacy 
*Data protection impact assessment*
*Security* > no more results public than necessary
*Anonymization*

Furthermore, before any results were exported from the remote secured online environment of Statistics Netherlands, the CBS tested the results to prevent publication of any identifiable information about individuals. 
The simulations are based on non-public microdata from Statistic Netherlands (CBS). The raw data were analyzed using R in the remote secured online environemnt of CBS. Before exporting the results, the results were tested by CBS to prevent publication of identifiable information about individuals. 
The results pertaining the number of (mis)matches between teacher's and EPST recommendation that are used in the current simulation study can be found in the folder "Table for simulation". The R code used to obtain this table, as well as the other tables/figures used in the research report, can be found in the Researc Report folder.
